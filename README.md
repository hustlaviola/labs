Height * branching factor == time complexity

space complexity == number of function calls, each call adds to the call stack

Tabulation Recipe

visualize the problem as a table
size the table based on the inputs
initialize the table with default values
seed the trivial answer into the table(base cases)
iterate through the table
fill further positions based on the current position
